    <h1>Investment Asset Classes for UK Citizens</h1>
    <div class="asset-class">
        <div class="asset-title">Stocks (Equities)</div>
        <div class="asset-description">
            Stocks represent ownership in companies. Investors buy shares of a company's stock and can benefit from potential capital appreciation and dividends.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="asset-class">
        <div class="asset-title">Bonds</div>
        <div class="asset-description">
            Bonds are debt securities issued by governments or corporations. Investors lend money in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the principal at maturity.
        </div>
    </div>


<div class="asset-class">
    <div class="asset-title">Mutual Funds</div>
    <div class="asset-description">
        Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. They're managed by professionals and provide an easy way to access diversified investments.

<div class="asset-class">
    <div class="asset-title">Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</div>
    <div class="asset-description">
        ETFs are similar to mutual funds but trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks. They offer diversification and typically have lower fees than traditional mutual funds.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="asset-class">
    <div class="asset-title">Real Estate</div>
    <div class="asset-description">
        Investing in real estate involves purchasing property with the expectation of generating rental income and/or capital appreciation. This can be done directly by buying properties or indirectly through real estate investment trusts (REITs).

    <div class="asset-description">

    </div>
</div>

<div class="asset-class">
    <div class="asset-title">Cryptocurrencies</div>
    <div class="asset-description">
        Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are digital assets that use blockchain technology. They are highly volatile and speculative investments that can offer significant gains but also carry substantial risks.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="asset-class">
    <div class="asset-title">Collectibles and Alternative Investments</div>
    <div class="asset-description">
        This includes investments in rare coins, art, vintage cars, and other unique items. These investments can be enjoyable for collectors, but their value can be highly subjective and volatile.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="asset-class">
    <div class="asset-title">Pension Funds</div>
    <div class="asset-description">
